## Technical Tutorial for Using Multiple Labels in Snorkel
<a> Yijie Chen </a>

### Introduction to Snorkel

As we know, one limitation of recent NLP tasks is the way to obtain **high-quality annotated** data. Therefore, researchers focus on different data augmentation functions trying to increase the size of labeled training sets by applying **class-preserving transformations** to create copies of labeled data points. In this tutorial, I want to show how to create multi-annotation with **Snorkel**, which directly **leverages and exploits SME domain knowledge** of transformation operations.
